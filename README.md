I have created a password generator that outputs a password in the prompt and on the page.
The interface is a soft pink color.
The user clicks on 'Generate Password' and is prompted to choose a number between 8 and 128. If they chose a number less than 8 and more than 128 they will get an "Invalid Entry!" prompt and the prompt stops.
If a user selects a numbe between 8 and 128, they are given a series of prompts that asks them to confirm or deny a series of characters they would like their password to contain.
The password is displayed as a prompt and in the textbox.
The options are special, numeric, lowercase and uppercase characters.

*********Note: I attempted to create the for loop at the end that would generate the number of characters the user selected but every line of code I created here seemed to stop the prompts from happening so I just let it be.
