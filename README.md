# PasswordGenerator
I created a password generator that prompts the user to make a selection of certain criteria to generate a unique password.
The interface of the page is a soft pick color.
When a user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, they are asked to enter a number between 8 and 128.
If a user selects a number outside this range, the prompt displays "Invalid Entry" and stops.
If a user selects a number between 8 and 128 they are given a series of prompts asking for certain criteria.
The criteria are numeric, special, lowercase, and uppercase characters.
Based on the users selections, the generator displays a unique password as a prompt and in the text box.

*******Note: I attempted to create the for loop for the end but couldn't. Every code I tried would stop the prompts from generating so I just left this as is.
